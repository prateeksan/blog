My first project on rails - A simple rails app built to test CRUD functionality. 

## Test it out:

` $ git clone https://github.com/prateeksan/blog.git`

` $ bundle install `

` $ bundle exec rake db:migrate `

` $ rails s `

Open up `localhost:3000` on your browser and you're all set! If you'd like to add comments, use the following to pass authentication:

_Username: "admin"_

_Password: "password"_
